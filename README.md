# economic-efficiency-of-subsidy-design

In this project, I perform analytic steps for a project that seeks to analyze the economic efficiency of subsidy design on the health insurance markets that were created in the US under the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA). 

Specifically, I generate a dataset of potential consumers on the health insurance markets through finding and cleaning the raw data in order to assist with estimating a model of demand of health insurance plans. I also create descriptive facts about the generated data, and estimate a regression model that would allow us to describe how subsidies (formally known as Advanced Premium Tax Credit) depend on individual and family characteristics.
