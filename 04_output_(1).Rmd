I present summary statistics about individuals and families in the data. The table reports the mean, standard deviation (S.D.), and 10th and 90th percentiles of demographics (age, sex, race, income) and subsidy levels at the family and individual levels. Specifically, the statistics regarding age, sex, race, individual income, and family member-level subsidy are presented at the individual level, and the statistics regarding household income, and family-level subsidy are presented at the family level. The number of individuals and fam- ilies that the summary statistics are based on is also reported in the “Count” column of the table. The table also shows the average coverage family size.
